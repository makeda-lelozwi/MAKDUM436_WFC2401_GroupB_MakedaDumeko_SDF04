//my problems started when we introduced this empty string next in the message variable...everytime i ran the code it would give the empty string in the console and not one of the messages like "you're out". My mistake: i didn't add messageEl.textContent = message into the renderGame() function.    
let message = ""

//grabbing the elements and saving them into variables became almost automatic and it actually blew my mind a little that getElementById() was a function. But it makes sense because: a) syntax but also, b) in the passenger counter lesson the instructor was like, the whole html document is an object.
